Garden of Bees
==============

Example Game: http://www.studio-owens.com/play/garden-of-bees/

These are the Flash ActionScript 2 class files that were used to create the Garden of Bees Flash game.

How To Use
-------------

I'll try to upload a demo .FLA file that shows how the class files are used to construct the game. The demo file would also be useful as a starting platform to build a new game.
